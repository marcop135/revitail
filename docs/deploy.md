# Deploy

`npm run build` writes a static site to `dist/`. Any static host serves it.

## Missing pages

This starter has one page. Unknown URLs must return HTTP 404 with `404.html`, not HTTP 200 with `index.html`.

| Host               | Setup                                                                            |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Apache             | Included: `public/.htaccess` returns 404 for unknown paths and serves `404.html` |
| Other static hosts | Configure `404.html` as the error document and preserve HTTP 404                 |

## Apache: `public/.htaccess`

- Forces HTTPS and sets HSTS, `nosniff`, frame, referrer and permissions headers.
- Caches `/assets/` (fingerprinted by Vite) for a year, icons and images for a week, HTML not at all.
- Sets a Content Security Policy of `'self'` plus the Matomo host. Replace `https://mt.marcopontili.com` with your analytics host, or remove it with Matomo.

The CSP blocks inline scripts. Load scripts from files, as `public/matomo.js` does; JSON-LD blocks are data and are allowed.

## Included deploy workflow

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` runs on push to `main`: test, build, upload `dist/` over SFTP (or FTPS), then purge Cloudflare. It needs these repository secrets:

| Secret                                                           | For                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `FTP_HOST`, `FTP_USERNAME_PRODUCTION`, `FTP_PASSWORD_PRODUCTION` | Upload                          |
| `SFTP_PORT`, `SFTP_KNOWN_HOSTS` or `FTPS_HOST`                   | SFTP with a pinned key, or FTPS |
| `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID`                     | Cache purge                     |

The purge targets `vitereact.marcopontili.com`; change the host in the workflow. If you deploy with Netlify, Vercel or Cloudflare Pages, delete the workflow and connect the repo there.

## Sourcemaps

Production builds emit `hidden` sourcemaps: the `.map` files exist for error-tracking uploads, but the JS does not reference them. Delete `dist/**/*.map` before upload if you do not use them.

## Environment variables

`VITE_*` variables are inlined at build time. Set them in the host's build environment or in `.env.production`; changing one needs a rebuild.
